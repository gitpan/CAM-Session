DESCRIPTION

This module implements CGI session state via a MySQL database.  If you
are just starting out, we recomment CGI::Session instead of this
module.

The Perl modules that CAM::Session most closely resemble are
CGI::Session and Apache::Session.  It's main advantages over those
module are:

 * Simplicity - there's almost nothing to configure
 * Compatibility with CAM::App and CAM::UserApp

It's disadvantages are:

 * Flexibility of the datastore - CAM::Session supports only MySQL
 * Some features, like distinguishing access time from creation time
 * CGI::Session is very popular
